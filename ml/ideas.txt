Other ideas:
- Single variable logistic regression past-1h future-1hr return sign
- Multiple variable linear regression with past-[x,y,z,...]-hr future-1hr
- Multiple variable logistic regression with past-[x,y,z,...]-hr future-1hr
- Play around with different cost functions
- Play around with different learning rates
- Add in a test set
- Get 'accuracy' in there
- Try initializing weights with zeroes instead of randomly
- Try outputting the change of line fits for each epoch

Questions:
- How do you visualize learning rates?
- What are epochs really?
- Why is this so slow even with less than 1000 datapoints?
